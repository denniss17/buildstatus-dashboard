# Status dashboard ðŸ“ŠðŸš¦

Dashboard for displaying the status and progress of your project.

Demo: https://buildstatus-dashboard.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction

This is a dashboard which combines the current scope of your project with the build statuses of your CI deployment 
to create a visual overview of the status of your project.

Basically, it combines two flow of data into a single dashboard:

- A list of issues which represent the current scope (sprint, milestone) of your project 
- The list of build statuses from a CI deployment (Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI) for these collected issues.
